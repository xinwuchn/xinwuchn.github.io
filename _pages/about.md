<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am specializing in the thermophysical properties of nanomaterials.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Currently</strong>, my focus is on enhancing the understanding and control of thermal transport in nanomaterials, particularly <strong>2D materials and their heterostructures</strong>. My expertise lies in developing and applying <strong>molecular dynamics simulations with machine-learned potentials</strong> and <strong>first principles calculation</strong> to explore and optimize thermal transport properties. This research seeks to unlock new possibilities for thermal management in electronic and energy devices by designing materials with customized thermal behaviors.
<br>
<br>
I received my <b>Ph.D. degree in Solid Mechanics</b> from the South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2023, under the mentorship of Prof. Qiang Han. During my studies, I enriched my experience through a one-year visiting Ph.D. position at the Institute of Industrial Science, the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), where I was under the guidance of Prof. Masahiro Nomura.
<br>
<br>
Here, I aim to present a multifaceted view of myself, from my CV and publication list to a blog where I record and share my thoughts and experiences. Welcome to you and your comments! ðŸ¤—
