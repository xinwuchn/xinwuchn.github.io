  abstract = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures stacked vertically by graphene (Gr) and hexagonal boron nitride
  (h-BN), by virtue of their novel properties, will undoubtedly spark great interests from the perspective of basic
  physics and applied science. Herein, phonon thermal transport across multilayer Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructures was
  systematically investigated by extensive molecular dynamics simulations, both in terms of internal structural
  configuration and external modulation. The former includes the structural configuration at the Gr/h-BN interface,
  the proportion of components in the effective heat transfer area, and size effect, while the latter includes
  cross-plane strain, temperature, and interfacial coupling strength. Our results show that at 300 K it has an
  ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of only about 8.93 MW/m/K, while the Gr/h-BN
  interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) is up to about 300 MW/m2/K, and the latter can be modulated in a wide range
  from 0.5 to 3.5 times under cross-plane strain. The analysis of the spectral decomposition results indicates that
  the thermal transport across the Gr/h-BN interface depends almost entirely on low-frequency out-of-plane phonons
  below 10 THz and the quantum effect can be ignorable, which uncovers the physical mechanisms underlying the
  changes in the ITC and also points the path toward its modulation.}

  abstract = {The van der Waals (vdW) superlattice, obtained by applying the concept of the periodic superlattice to two-dimensional materials using low-energy vdW physical assembly, is undoubtedly an instrumental avenue for the modulation of material properties. In the field of nanoscale thermal transport, the influence of the periodic structure of superlattice on the wave-particle phonon transport regime arouses substantial interests from the standpoint of basic physics and applied science. In the Graphene/h-BN vdW superlattice, we have found the wave-particle crossover of phonon transport, which is reflected in the transition from incoherent to coherent regime as the interface density increases. The analysis reveals that the increased thermal conductivity owing to coherent transport effects will amply compensate for the progressively increasing interface phonon scattering throughout this process. In addition, due to the stronger effects of the above two aspects, the superlattices with higher interface density are more sensitive to changes in temperature and interface coupling strength, which are manifested in the rate of change in thermal conductivity caused by their alteration, respectively. These results establish an in-depth understanding of coherent phonon transport while exploring the possibility of phonon wave-particle crossover in vdW superlattices, providing guidance for related thermal management based on phonon engineering.}

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) in-plane heterostructures, whose interface thermal conductance (ITC) plays a crucial role in the thermal performance of nanostructured materials, will undoubtedly become the focus of the next-generation nanoelectronic devices. In this work, the semidefective graphene/hexagonal boron nitride in-plane heterostructures were innovatively proposed based on topological defects, and the thermal conductance across its interface was studied by molecular dynamics simulations. Surprisingly, the topological defects of a certain component in the heterostructure can significantly improve its ITC without changing the interfacial structure, and it is expected to be controlled by the defective concentration and the average temperature of the system. In particular, based on the different defective objects, the improvement of the ITC exhibits a radically different trend as the defective concentration increases. After the phonon activities were captured to explore the underlying physical mechanisms, it is found that the phonon coupling on both sides of the interface and the phonon localization effect of the heterostructure are two pivotal factors that determine the ITC of the heterostructure. The discovery of these results suggests a new path forward for improving or even controlling the ITC of the 2D in-plane heterostructures.}

  abstract = {The simple and practicable intrinsic driving mechanism is of great significance for the design and development of nanoscale devices. This paper proposes a nanosystem that can achieve directional gradientless thermoexcited rotation at a relatively high temperature field (such as 300 K). In the case of a constant temperature field, the difference in atomic van der Waals (VDW) potentials in different regions of the rotor can be achieved by an asymmetric design of the structure, which provides torque for the rotation of the rotor. We studied the rotation and driving mechanism of the designed system through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and discussed the influence of the chiral combination of carbon nanotubes, the chirality of graphene substrate, the length of graphene substrate, and the system temperature on rotation. At the same time, this paper also makes a qualitative analysis of the feasibility of the designed system from the perspective of molecular mechanics combined with energy. This research provides a new idea of nanoscale driving rotation, which has guiding significance for the design and application of related nanodevices in the future.}

The present article is intended to study on thermal transport properties of defective graphene by comparing the effects of topological defects on the thermal conductivity of graphene. This study developed a program for constructing defective graphene models with customizable defect concentrations and distribution types. The efficient molecular dynamics method based on graphics processing units is applied, which can achieve efficient and accurate calculation of material thermal conductivity. It is revealed that the existence of topological defects has a considerable reduce on the thermal conductivity of graphene, and the declining rate of the value get less with increasing defects concentration. At the same concentration, the weakening effect of SW defects on the thermal conductivity of graphene is evidently less than the other two defects. We also explored the effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of graphene with different defects. These findings were discussed from the phonon perspective that elucidate the atomic level mechanisms, which provide guidance for thermal management of graphene devices.}

To this end, a defective h-BN model construction program has been developed, which can customize the nature of the defects and realize the transition from the defect state to the amorphous state. By performing homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on Tersoff multi-body potential, the thermal conductivity results of large-size h-BN films have been achieved. For the defect state h-BN, we studied the effect of different defect types and concentrations on its thermal conductivity and verified it from the phonon mechanism. After the transition to two-dimensional amorphous BN, we discussed and analyzed the influence of amorphous concentration, amorphous defect ratio and temperature on its thermal transport properties. On this basis, the restriction relationship between phonon-phonon scattering term and phonon-defect scattering term was also proposed from the atomic level mechanisms. Our results constitute a step in the deterministic engineering of thermal management devices in 2D materials, and hold great promise for the application of h-BN defect engineering in the field of nanomaterial thermal design.}

Results based on three different versions of the MD method consistently showed that the lattice thermal conductivity of the pristine 2D-PANI is up to around
. It decreases significantly after the introduction of structural defects and is essentially in a low-power law with the defects concentration. In addition, the difference in the weakening of thermal conductivity between vacancy and topological defects stems mainly from their respective differential effects on the low-frequency out-of-plane phonons. Remarkably, it also reveals the potential mutual constraints between anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering and phonon-defect scattering. These findings provide guidance for the thermal management of 2D-PANI-based electronic devices and are also expected to advance their application in the field of thermal design of nanomaterials.}

Analysis of the decomposition of the in-plane and out-of-plane contributions, which is of interest in laminated quasi-2D structures, shows that the out-of-plane part dominated by the influence of the vibrational modes, combined with the in-plane part under the influence of the compensation effect between the boundary scattering and the cavity barriers, together contribute to the thermal conductivity anomalous maximum. From property exploration to in-depth phonon analysis, a deep understanding of the phonon thermal transport behavior of multilayer graphene with periodic 2D-ES has been established, which is expected to further advance its application in the field of thermal management and design of nanomaterials.}

 widespread interests and potential application prospects in terms of their physically interesting features. Herein,
  we have found wave-particle crossover of phonon transport in the graphene (Gr)/2D polyaniline (C3N) lateral superlattices, which is an indication of a transition in the phonon transport mechanism from the incoherent to coherent regime. Due to the high structural similarity of C3N to Gr, the thermal conductivity of the Gr/C3N lateral superlattice can achieve an ultra-wide modulation range of about
 W/mK, which is far beyond that of other superlattices. The analysis shows that an increase of the interface density will on the one hand weaken the thermal conductivity by increasing phonon-interface scattering, and on the other hand increase it by lowering the phonon transport barriers and allowing more long-wavelength phonons to participate in the transport. This determines the parabolic trend of thermal conductivity containing the minimum, and also reflects the dual effects of hetero-interfaces on phonon thermal transport. In addition, phonon calculations show that the above variation in thermal conductivity is entirely attributable to differences in the phonon mean free path for different interface densities and is not related to their group velocity.}

Three patterns of graphene platelets (GPLs) describe the layer-wise variation of material properties in the thickness direction. Based on the Reissner-Mindlin plate theory and the isogeometric analysis, elastodynamic wave equation for the piezoelectric composite plate is derived by Hamilton’s principle and parameterized with the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The equation is transformed into a second-order polynomial eigenvalue problem with regard to wave dispersion. Then, the semi-analytical approach is validated by comparing with the existing results and the convergence on computing dispersion behaviors is also demonstrated. The effects of various distributions, volume fraction, size parameters and piezoelectricity of GPLs as well as different geometry parameters of the composite plate on dispersion characteristics are discussed in detail.

This paper proposes a genre of valley phases with one, two, and three topological edge states created by transforming the structure of unit cells. The bulk-edge correspondence indicates that these edge states are topological based on the topological invariant number (i.e., the valley Chern number of one, two, and three) of this system coinciding with the number of topological edge states. Different types of defects are introduced into the phononic crystals, whose transmission spectra show that they can withstand bending defects.
